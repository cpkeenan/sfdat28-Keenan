## Potential Project Ideas

What data are you planning to use to answer that question? What do you know about the data so far? Why did you choose these topics?

##### Ideas:

1. The perfect pop song
	*  I want to predict if a Pop song will be a hit similar to these two articles - [here](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/the-perfect-pop-song-its-the-algorithm-not-the-rhythm-that-counts-7962590.html) and [here](https://www.wired.com/2011/12/hit-potential-equation/).
	*  I know there are databases that hold this data - the EMI One Million Interview dataset - but I would like to determine if I can first scrape Spotify to test my knowledge of using APIs there first and then use a package like Fourier Transform to convert the song data into waves and analyze form there.
	*  My main concern is that this will be labor intensive to convert everything but I'm more concerned about the time against it. Running scripts against a huge dataset like this will require lots of computing power and lots of time unless I can devise another way to go about it (most likely with your help).
	*  I'm excited about this idea because I love pop music and determining if there is a way to understand what makes people "like" a song is very intriguing to me.

2. Training a neural network to recognize shoplifting
	* Just like the title above, I would like to determine if there is a way to recognize retail shoplifting techniques via image or video recognition.
	* I have been in contact with a private retail security company that might be able to provide video and images that I could feed into a neural network but I would like to explore TensorFlow before relying on them to provide.
	* I would imagine that my main challenge will be determining how the algorithm will recognize slight movements but more so I'm concerned that we won't get to this until later in the class and I'll be struggling to understand. I'll probably pick something easier but I'm very interested in this.
	* I want to give this idea a try if possible because my Dad has been in retail security his entire life and he has been hoping for a tool like this for his entire career. My hope is to be able to provide for him in this instance.

3. Predicting stock market similarity buys 
	* The idea is to scrape Google Finance for information revolving around if stock prices go up for stocks that resemble stocks that are just about to IPO or stocks that recently shot up.
	* I think this will be relatively simple to do using some of the techniques we've learned so far.
	* My main challenge will be determining how to limit the similar stocks around the main stock I'm targeting. I have yet to figure out how I will do that.
	* I want to do this because if I could determine an algorithm that was semi accurate. I would want to learn how to implement this package into a system and put some money behind it. ;)
	* I think this is probably the most reasonable of all three to get a first draft of by the required date.

##### Other Ideas

1. Automating gun ownership paperwork.
	* Family friend owns gun shop and consolidating the paperwork into one lookup would benefit his time greatly by using a model to consolidate lookup databases and predict potential ownership risk.
2. How many tweets does it take for something to go viral?
	* Scraping Twitter to determine what is the minimum amount of tweets it takes a post to go viral and mapping the outcome of how many people are able visualize it.


##### Contingency Plan

If all else fails, I will try the Outbrain Click Prediction competition on Kaggle. The dataset and objective are clear and I feel that it would offer a realistic example of problems I would face in the world of Data Science if I were to pursue that path.
